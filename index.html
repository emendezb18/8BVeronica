        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Cold War was a period of ongoing political rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, but there were some allies involved in the war. It started on March 12, 1947, and ended on December 25, 1991. The Cold War is named like that because all the conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union never heated up in person or into direct war. But during the Cold war happening other events and conflicts, like the Cuban Missile Crisis

            After the Cold War, the United States established itself as the
            world's only superpower.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its economy experienced continued growth in the 1990s, and
            significant technological expansion occurred with the rise of the
            information industry.

            Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia experienced a
            tumultuous transition to a market economy and a democratic form of
            government. There were economic and political challenges, with the
            privatization of state-owned companies and the consolidation of
            political power under Vladimir Putin.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 2000s, Russia began to regain its economic stability and play
            a more active role in international affairs.

            The fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany marked
            an important milestone in European history. The European Union (EU)
            expanded, integrating several Eastern European countries. Over the
            years, the EU continued to grow stronger, adopting a common
            currency, the euro, in several of its member countries.

            China experienced rapid economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s,
            becoming a global economic power. It partially embraced the market
            economy, while maintaining a one-party political system.
            Technological development and the expansion of its global influence
            were distinctive trends in this period.

            Cuba faced a deep economic crisis known as the "Special Period in
            Time of Peace." The Cuban economy had been heavily dependent on
            Soviet economic assistance, and its collapse had a significant
            impact.
